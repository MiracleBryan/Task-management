*** Important to include appspec.yml into your CodeBuild's artifact!
The AppSpec file for an EC2/On-Premises deployment must be named appspec.yml or appspec.yaml, unless you are performing a local deployment. 

*** Ensure that CodeDeploy agent is installed in Ubuntu EC2 instance:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install-ubuntu.html

CodeBuild will use the buildspec.yml to build the application.
CodeDeploy will use AppSpec.yml to deploy the application to EC2.
For this project, we used Sydney Server.
Thus, the CodeDeploy agent install script is:
https://aws-codedeploy-ap-southeast-2.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/latest/install

Deployment Logging from EC2:
tail -f /var/log/aws/codedeploy-agent/codedeploy-agent.log

*** If create EC2 instance from scratch, create IAM role and attach to EC2 model.

All deployed artifacts from CodeBuild will be in the /opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/ folder.
Check all your build artifacts there.
