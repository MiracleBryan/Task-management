## Suggested Improvements on the App ##

~ Task dateline should not be set to a day in the past.
~ Description editing should be single click, not doube.
~ Description editing should be confirmed and closed with the enter key.
~ Uppercase "Task" name in header.
~ When multiple tasks are added and due date is null, editing task name is glitchy
~ When you click the advanced_search_btn the icon should flip indicating you need to click the button again to minimize the window
