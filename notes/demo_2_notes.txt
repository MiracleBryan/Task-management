=== Notes For Demo 2 ===

Past Changes:
+ Past Update Request by Jonathan:
    ~ Registration now has a "Registered" notification when a user has been registered.
    ~ Deleting a task requires a confirmation dialog now instead of instantly deleting.

Sprint 2 Implementation:
+ Notifications:
    ~ Notifications like connection request and connection are implemented with websockets.
    ~ So, notification is pushed to the client.
+ Connection Request:
    ~ Send a connection request to another user.
    ~ Accept / delete connection request.
    ~ Demo notification on sending a connection request. 
        ~ Fail to find user, Connection request sent, Cannot connect to self, Cannot double send request.
    ! If asked about where can we see the requests? It's in next sprint, when we can see other user's profile.
+ Connection:
    ~ User can assign a task to an established connection.
    ~ User can delete an established connection.
        ~ Upon deleting an established connection, disconnected users cannot see the task which the user has just disconnected from.
        ~ The other user which is currently just being unfriended by the other user can still see the tasks, 
          but will not be able to update the task which is assigned previously by the disconnected user.
          Attempt to do so will be notified with an update failure notification at the bottom right.
        ~ Demo on two browser, delete an established connection, make sure task of just disconnected user cannot be seen.
            ~ The other user will not be permitted to update the task and will be notified upon update failure.
    ~ Deleting an established connection will ensure that tasks cannot be assigned to disconnected user.
        ~ Demo on two browser, delete an established connection, make sure task cannot be assigned from user1 to user2.
+ Filters:
    ~ Repositioned around the screen for better view. So, it doesn't block the task list.
    ~ Toggle active searching to flip between search mode and normal view mode.
    ~ Rule based search that allows user to aggregate rules on different columns.
    ~ Supported rule aggregation is (And, Or).
    ~ Different columns have different conditions constraint.
        ~ Example, dates have "before" and "between" condition to filter before and between two dates.
+ Busyness:
    ~ Added busyness visualization chart.
+ Dark Mode:
    ~ Can refresh the page and the dark mode configuration will be persistent.
